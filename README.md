# Joanie's Adventure

An adventure mini-game made for Joanie. 


**About**

Joanie is an amazing woman. She helps many people throughout her life, including me. Because of some disability, she's not able to jump or run in real life. This game is made for her so that she can play and jump and dance with animals in the virtual world.

This game is made with Unreal Engine 4.25. It was designed for the android mobile experience but you can also try it out on with PC controls.
